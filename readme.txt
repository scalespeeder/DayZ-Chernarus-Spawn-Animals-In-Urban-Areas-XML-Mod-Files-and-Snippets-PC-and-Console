DayZ Animals Spawn In Chernarus Urban Areas XML Mod For Consoles & PC XML Snippets Instructions & Terms Of Use

These snippets add additional Chernarus urban spawns (villages, towns & citis) for the Bears, Wolves, Red & Roe Deer & the Wild Boar. 

WARNING! THESE BEARS AND WOLVES CAN BE DIFFICULT TO KILL, SO THIS CAN MAKE SURVIVAL ON YOUR SERVER MUCHER HARDER!

THESE MODS DO NOT INCREASE THE FREQUENCY OF ANIMAL SPAWNS, SO ANIMALS WILL REMAIN RARE. 

These new spawn points are based on the locations of the water wells on Chernarus.

Limited Testing on PC Chernarus Local Server DAYZ Version 1.20 MAY 2023.

Using these modded xml / json files and instructions could break the functioning of your DAYZ server, requiring a reinstall that would wipe
all player progress.

Using these modded files neccessitates increased regular restarts to prevent server crashing.

It is suggested you thoroughly test your server after applying these files to ensure proper
functioning of your server.

I always recomend you validate your files at: https://www.xmlvalidation.com/ and https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/

Instructions:
	
Simply upload the supplied territory files into your DayZ Chernarus Mission env directory (over the top of the existing ones) and restart your server.

OR

Use the supplied  "basic urban list of graze locations" file to add the coordinates to the territory files of your choice, save and restart your server.
(PLEASE NOTE when adding to the wolves territory you will need to change "Graze" to "HuntingGround"

PLEASE NOTE: To increase the chance of animal urban spawns you could also decrease the  <saferadius>200</saferadius> of
each relevant animal event to  <saferadius>100</saferadius>.

Thanks, Rob.
